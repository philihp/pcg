A functional implementation of the [PCG family random number generators](), written in JavaScript.

[PCG family random number generators]: http://pcg-random.org

## Getting started

To achieve frictionless reproducibility of random output results, immutable objects are used throughout the project.

First, create a starting state. A stream ID is a unique and distinct periodic series of entropy. The state specifies _where_ in that series we start.

```
import { createPcg32 } from 'pcg'

const advancedOptions = {}
const initState = 42
const initStreamId = 54
const state0 = createPcg32(advancedOptions, initState, initStreamId)
```

After that, random outputs can be generated by calling appropriate functions as shown below:

```js
import { nextState, prevState, randomInt, randomList } from 'fn-pcg'

const randomUint32 = randomInt(0, 2 ** 32 - 1)
const [value, nextState] = randomUint32(state0)

const listLength = 3
const listItemRng = randomUint32
const [[v1, state1], [v2, state2], [v3, state3]] = randomList(listLength, listItemRng, state0)
```

In this above example, `value === v1`, and `nextState === state1`
